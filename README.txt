// Timetable Application

The program requires a user to log in as a student, lecturer or admin. This requires an ID from the respective CSV files. As a student, you have options to view: User Timetable, Room Timetable, Module Timetable, Course Timetable and Group information. As a lecturer, you have the same options, minus group information. As an admin, you must login using a password. An admin can set the term and add/remove entries from a timetable. Users have the option to logout, and log back in as a new user. 
Students specifically are split into groups, and each group has a subgroup.
Rooms cannot be double booked, nor can student groups have conflict with booking classes.
